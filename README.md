# Analyzing-Success-Rates-in-Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Clinics


The primary objective of this data analytics project is to predict the success rates of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics in the United States in 2020. This study will explore the influence of patient factors, particularly the use of patients' own eggs or donor eggs, on the clinic's success rate.
Data Source and Information:
The project will utilize data from the National ART Surveillance System (NASS), which collects comprehensive information from fertility clinics across the U.S. This dataset comprises 3 key components:
* ART Locations: This dataset contains information related to the geographical locations of fertility clinics and their profiles within the United States.
* ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics: This dataset includes data related to patient characteristics, cycle-specific details, and other relevant information.
* ART Success Rates: The success rates dataset contains critical information on the success of ART cycles initiated during the year in question. Success rates are presented separately for patients using their own eggs and donor eggs. The success rates are cumulative and account for transfers that occur within one year after an egg retrieval.
